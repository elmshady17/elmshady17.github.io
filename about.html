    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>Hello and welcome to my about me section! I am currently a senior at Woodstock Public High School interested in working with physics and chemistry in materials engineering. I own two 3D printers and like to make useful tools, gifts, and figures with them. Materials science and Engineering is my current top pick for major, as it combines my interests in new and exciting ways for me. Just the scope the field offers is breathtaking. When I'm not checking my printer or adding supports to models you'll find me either listening to music, playing music on one of my many instruments, reading, or gaming with friends. </p>
    
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>From a young age I always liked making. It started with those science kits you buy kids, the ones like the baking soda volcano and little microscopes. In middle school I got my first computer, beginning a long road to many other forms of creating. I made my first game in 7th grade, and a follow up one in 8th grade. They weren't the best, but they taught me a lot about how difficult coding is. I never tired of digital making, but I did refocus into the physical realm. </p>
    
    <h3>Skills</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</li>
        <li>Python, Java</li>
        <li>Web Development</li>
        <li>Git & GitHub</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>3D printing, learning 3D modeling, reading, friends, gaming, walking/biking, fishing, art, and many others.</p>
